A classification model based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm written in Java, implemented with colleagues. The program creates a window interface that is divided into: 
- navigation bar where you can generate the data that is used by the algorithm, you can choose which algorithm you want to use and a simulation control
- the area to draw, where the data appear in a two-dimensional graph.
